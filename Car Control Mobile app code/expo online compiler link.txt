Note: The app may not work fully as expected right now because it depends on an API and a database that is currently stored locally and not online. To help you visualize how the app works, we’ve added some routes:

- Go to Add Cars
- Enter any Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
- Click Add Car (the app will try to connect to the database for about 2 minutes, then fail)
- An "Error: Car Not Found" message will appear
- Click Close – this will take you to the Car Control page (this is intentional, not a bug)
- Tap the Profile Image to go to the Profile screen
- Tap Unlock to go to the Feature Control screen
